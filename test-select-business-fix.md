#### Visual Feedback Improvements:

## How to Test

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. Login to the application
2. Navigate to `/auth/select-business` (or be redirected there after login)
3. Click on a business item rapidly multiple times
4. **Expected**: Only first click is processed
5. **Expected**: All business items become unclickable during selection
6. **Expected**: Selected business shows with border and 70% opacity
7. **Expected**: Other businesses show with 50% opacity
8. **Expected**: No multiple API calls or console errors

### What Was Fixed:
- **Before**: Users could click business items multiple times causing multiple API calls
- **Now**:
  - 500ms debounce prevents rapid clicks
  - All items become unclickable during selection
  - Clear visual feedback shows which business is being selected
  - Smooth transition to dashboard without multiple navigation attempts

### Visual Improvements:
- Hover effect on business items when not loading
- Active scale effect (0.98) for click feedback
- Different opacity levels to show selection state
- Cursor changes to not-allowed for unselectable items
